# Covid-19 Dashboard
This open-source project is an interactive Covid-19 dashboard that allows users to visualize the number of Covid-19 cases or deaths per country as a function of time. The dashboard is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building web-based data apps.

## Data Source
The Covid-19 data for all countries in the world is provided by Our World in Data, which offers a comprehensive and reliable dataset on the pandemic. The data is updated daily and can be accessed via their GitHub repository: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data

## Technical Stack
The Covid-19 dashboard is built using Python 3.8+ and Streamlit. Streamlit is a powerful library that allows us to create interactive data apps with only a few lines of Python code. It offers a wide range of widgets and visualization tools to explore and communicate data.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, clone the repository and run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the necessary Python packages, including Streamlit and Pandas.
## Usage
To launch the Covid-19 dashboard, run the following command:

```
streamlit run project/app.py
```
This will open a new tab in your default browser with the Covid-19 dashboard. From there, you can select the desired country, data type (cases or deaths), and time range using the interactive widgets.
